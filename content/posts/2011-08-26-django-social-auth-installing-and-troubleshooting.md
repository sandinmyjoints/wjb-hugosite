Thanks to `django-registration`, I was able to build a working account
registration/login system pretty easily. But I wanted to give users the ability
to use their existing accounts through popular services such as Facebook,
Twitter, etc., rather than have to create yet another account. Here's how I did
it.

# Sorting Through the Choices #

There are a number of reusable Django apps out there to help with
registration/login from social media sites. I found this [Review of 4 Django Social Auth apps](http://hackerluddite.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/review-of-4-django-social-auth-apps/)
very helpful in sorting out the options. After reading it, I was left to choose
between [`django-social-auth`](https://github.com/omab/django-social-auth) (I
originally linked to the wrong app here, but this link is correct) and
[`django-allauth`](https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth). In the end, I
went with `django-social-auth` (not to be confused with `django-socialauth`)
because a friend had recommended it and because I'd already installed it before
I read this article. However, the article's conclusion that `django-allauth` is
best out of the box also seems valid.

# Installation #

The instructions in [`django-social-auth`'s docs](http://django-social-auth.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) are helpful in
walking you through available settings and options.

I also found the included example app useful. To use this app, I cloned
`django-social-auth`'s git repo, created a virtualenv called
`django-social-auth`, ran `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside this
virtualenv to install all the required apps, ran `manage.py syncdb`, and finally
ran `manage.py runserver`. Voila, example app is up and running at 127.0.0.1,
showing a simple screen with options to login through about a dozen different
different services.

# API Keys #

The first service I tested was Twitter. I use it more than any others, and I
already had the API keys for it. I threw my API key and secret key into the
example `local_settings.py` file provided with `django-social-auth` and tried to
log in via the example app. Boom: `401 Unauthorized`. I double-checked all my
settings and installation and whatnot. Seemed fine.

I turned my attention to the API keys. The ones I had were generated for
[Readsr](http://www.readsrs.com), i.e., I entered readsrs.com as the domain when
I generated them at dev.twitter.com. But now I was running on localhost,
127.0.0.1, so I suspected the readsrs.com keys wouldn't be valid. I wasn't sure
whether Twitter would hand over a new consumer key for 127.0.0.1, or baulk at
the request. (It seemed like it should do so, but I hadn't seen any instructions
anywhere that said to get a key for your development machine.) Turns out Twitter
will happily give you a key for 127.0.0.1. Once I plugged the new keys in, I was
able to log in with my Twitter credentials, and just as it should,
`django-social-auth` automatically created an `auth.user` for this account.

# Integrating with Readsr #

I followed the instructions again to config my own app, Readsr. To add a login
option using Twitter credentials, I put a link to the reversed view that begins
the `django-social-auth` login process for twitter, i.e., {% raw %}`{% url
socialauth_begin "twitter" %}`{% endraw %}, to my login template. And it worked.

I still need to fix a few oddities. For example, Twitter returns my first and
last names together in `first_name` (or else `django-social-auth` is
concatenating them into that column), and doesn't supply any email address. But
the basic functionality is there, and was relatively easy to achieve.

# Postscript #

The author of the article I linked above had an error using OpenID when using `django-social-auth`, which is why he preferred `django-authall`. He filed a bug
for the error he got, and I notice that [it was closed](https://github.com/omab/django-social-auth/issues/67) 15 hours ago
(though if you read the comments, it seems it was actually fixed back in
mid-July). Good timing.
